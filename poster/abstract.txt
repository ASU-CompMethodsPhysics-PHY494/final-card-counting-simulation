Why we are Dropping out of College: AKA Blackjack Card Counting 
Simulation

Ryan Heilman, Layne Bradshaw, Jacob Dwyer

The purpose of this project was to determine not only whether or not 
card counting in the game of blackjack is a viable strategy, but what a 
successful betting scheme would look like. The major hurdles that needed 
to be overcome for a success was the implementation of code that could 
simultaneously run a card game, while keeping the card count, and 
solving the math required given by the High-Lo  counting system. This 
was accomplished via object oriented programming that would set up a 
game with players and determine whether or not to hit/stay and how much 
one should bet according to the cards and rules that were provided. The 
simulation was successful in the sense that we found betting patterns 
with net gains, while others produced large losses in a players 
bankroll. With over 1000 simulations run, we found, for the most part, 
that more conservative patterns led to larger overall gains. For 
example, a strategy with wagers ranging from $145-$165 led to an annual 
income between $250,000 and $350,000 per year.
