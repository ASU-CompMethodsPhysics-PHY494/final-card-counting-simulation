Blackjack Card Counting Simulation

Ryan Heilman, Layne Bradshaw, Jacob Dwyer

The purpose of this project was to determine whether or not card counting in the game of blackjack is a viable strategy for winning and money-making. This was interesting, as a successful implementation could show if vast amounts of money could be made by playing a card game. The major hurdles that needed to be overcome for a success was the implementation of code that could simultaneously run a card game, while keeping the “card count”, and solving the math required given by the “High-Lo” system. This was accomplished via rudimentary “artificial intelligence” that, through the use of self-defined functions, if/else statements, classes and objects, for/while loops, and numpy arrays could determine whether or not to hit, stay, or bet according to the cards and rules that were provided. Looking at the results produced by the simulations, the goal was definitely achieved. The plots provided show that for certain betting schemes, a large amount of money could be made over the course of a year, while for others, less money was made. Conclusively, found through this experiment, card-counting is a viable option for making plenty of money while playing blackjack.
